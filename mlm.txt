## Database Schema (MLM Specific)

```sql
-- Referral Tree
referral_tree (
  id, user_id, sponsor_id, upline_id, 
  position, level, placement_date
)

-- Commissions
commissions (
  id, user_id, from_user_id, amount, 
  commission_type, level, task_id, period, status
)

-- Ranks
user_ranks (
  id, user_id, rank, achieved_date, 
  personal_volume, team_volume, active_downlines
)

## MLM Business Logic

### Commission Calculation Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateCommissions(taskCompletion) {
  const user = taskCompletion.user;
  const earnings = taskCompletion.points_earned;
  
  // Get upline chain (5-10 levels)
  const uplineChain = getUplineChain(user.id, 10);
  
  uplineChain.forEach((uplineUser, level) => {
    if (uplineUser.isQualified(level)) {
      const commissionRate = getCommissionRate(level, uplineUser.rank);
      const commission = earnings * commissionRate;
      
      createCommission({
        user_id: uplineUser.id,
        from_user_id: user.id,
        amount: commission,
        level: level + 1,
        type: 'level_commission'
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### Rank Advancement Logic
```javascript
function checkRankAdvancement(userId, period) {
  const stats = getUserStats(userId, period);
  const currentRank = getUserRank(userId);
  
  const qualifications = {
    personal_volume: stats.personal_task_earnings,
    team_volume: stats.team_task_earnings,
    active_referrals: stats.active_downlines,
    direct_referrals: stats.direct_referrals
  };
  
  const newRank = calculateEligibleRank(qualifications);
  
  if (newRank > currentRank) {
    promoteUser(userId, newRank);
    triggerRankBonus(userId, newRank);
  }
}
```
